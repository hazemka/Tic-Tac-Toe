## 🕹️ How to Play

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.


* Players take turns placing their markers (X or O) by entering numbers 1–9 corresponding to the grid positions:


* Game Board

    `1 | 2 | 3`
    
    `4 | 5 | 6`
    
    `7 | 8 | 9`


* The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.


* Select the game mode (Two Players or Player with AI).


* Start playing ...


* If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
